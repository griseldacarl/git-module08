Part B
Create a folder and initialize it as a repo. In that repo, create at least three files:

A Python program/script. The contents don't really matter, it can be something you're working on, code from a previous project, or even just a "Hello World".
A file called README.md. A GitHub convention is to include readme file with a description of the project/repo, and it's usually in markdownLinks to an 
external site. format (hence the .md extension). The contents don't matter, but you're welcome to experiment with Markdown syntax to see how it works. 
VS Code supports Markdown with dynamic previewLinks to an external site.. You could also use something like https://www.makeareadme.com/Links to an external
site. to throw something together.
A third file of your choice. Maybe another .py file. Maybe a picture of your cat.
Commit and publish your repo on GitHub. Then, make changes to at least two of the files and commit them. You should have at least two commits on GitHub.
